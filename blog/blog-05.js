		"Managing cloud networks across regions and subscriptions can get complicated fast! But with Azure Virtual Network Manager (AVNM), you can take control by applying connectivity topologies and security policies at scale. In this talk, we’ll explore how AVNM helps organizations centralize network management, enforce consistent security rules, and simplify complex network setups like hub-and-spoke topologies without manual intervention. We'll also cover real-world scenarios to show how AVNM can reduce operational complexity and improve security posture in a dynamic cloud environment. If you’re looking to streamline network operations and ensure secure, scalable Azure networks, this session is for you",
